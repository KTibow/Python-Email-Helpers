Welcome to the contributing guidelines.
If you find a bug, follow these steps:
  1. See if it is already an issue. If it is closed, try following their steps. If it is open, feel free to say "I had that problem too!",
  and click that watch button.
  2. If it doesn't have an issue, make one! Things to add are:
  + If it gave an exception, say it. If not, say exactly what happened.
  + Say the code you were running, or if you were using the interactive shell, give a screenshot of all of the code you ran.
  + Say all of the instructions you followed to setup the library.

This is quite empty right now, so please suggest ideas.
